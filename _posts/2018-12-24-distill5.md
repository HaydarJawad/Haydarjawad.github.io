# Set Theory Basics

## What is Set Theory?
Set theory is like organising things into groups (called sets). Imagine you have a bunch of different toys. You can group them into sets like "cars," "dolls," and "blocks."

### Definitions:
- Set (S): A collection of objects (called elements). For example, if you have toys, your set could be: $$ S = \{ \text{car, doll, block} \} $$
- Element: An object in a set. In the set above, "car" is an element.
- Sample Space (S): The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. If you toss a coin, the sample space is: $$ S = \{ \text{Heads (H), Tails (T)} \} $$

### Types of Sets:
- Finite Set: A set with a limited number of elements. For example, a set of primary colours: $$ \{ \text{Red, Blue, Yellow} \} $$
- Infinite Set: A set with unlimited elements. For example, the set of all positive numbers: $$ \{ 1, 2, 3, \ldots \} $$

### Important Operations on Sets:
- Union ( $$ A \cup B $$ ): Combines all elements from both sets A and B.
- Intersection ( $$ A \cap B $$ ): Includes only elements found in both sets A and B.
- Complement ( $$ A^C $$ ): Includes everything not in set A.

### Examples:
- Union Example: If $$ A = \{ \text{apple, banana} \} $$ and $$ B = \{ \text{banana, cherry} \} $$, then $$ A \cup B = \{ \text{apple, banana, cherry} \} $$
- Intersection Example: If $$ A = \{ \text{apple, banana} \} $$ and $$ B = \{ \text{banana, cherry} \} $$, then $$ A \cap B = \{ \text{banana} \} $$
- Complement Example: If the universal set $$ U = \{ \text{apple, banana, cherry, date} \} $$ and $$ A = \{ \text{apple, banana} \} $$, then $$ A^C = \{ \text{cherry, date} \} $$

### Basic Properties:
- Commutativity:
  - Union: $$ A \cup B = B \cup A $$
  - Intersection: $$ A \cap B = B \cap A $$
- Associativity:
  - Union: $$ A \cup (B \cup C) = (A \cup B) \cup C $$
  - Intersection: $$ A \cap (B \cap C) = (A \cap B) \cap C $$
- Distributive Laws:
  - $$ A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) $$
  - $$ A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C) $$
- De Morgan’s Laws:
  - $$ (A \cup B)^C = A^C \cap B^C $$
  - $$ (A \cap B)^C = A^C \cup B^C $$

## Set Theory Properties with Examples

1. **Commutativity**
   - Union ( $$ A \cup B $$ ): The order in which you combine sets doesn't matter.
     - Example: If $$ A = \{ \text{apple, banana} \} $$ and $$ B = \{ \text{banana, cherry} \} $$, then $$ A \cup B = B \cup A = \{ \text{apple, banana, cherry} \} $$
   - Intersection ( $$ A \cap B $$ ): The order in which you find common elements doesn't matter.
     - Example: Using the same sets, $$ A \cap B = B \cap A = \{ \text{banana} \} $$

2. **Associativity**
   - Union ( $$ A \cup (B \cup C) $$ ): It doesn't matter how you group the sets when you combine them.
     - Example: If $$ A = \{ \text{apple} \} $$, $$ B = \{ \text{banana} \} $$, and $$ C = \{ \text{cherry} \} $$, then $$ A \cup (B \cup C) = (A \cup B) \cup C = \{ \text{apple, banana, cherry} \} $$
   - Intersection ( $$ A \cap (B \cap C) $$ ): It doesn't matter how you group the sets when you find common elements.
     - Example: If $$ A = \{ 1, 2, 3 \} $$, $$ B = \{ 2, 3, 4 \} $$, and $$ C = \{ 3, 4, 5 \} $$, then $$ A \cap (B \cap C) = (A \cap B) \cap C = \{ 3 \} $$

3. **Distributive Laws**
   - Intersection over Union ( $$ A \cap (B \cup C) $$ ): Finding common elements with the union of other sets is the same as combining the intersections separately.
     - Example: If $$ A = \{ \text{apple, banana} \} $$, $$ B = \{ \text{banana, cherry} \} $$, and $$ C = \{ \text{cherry, date} \} $$, then $$ A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) = \{ \text{banana} \} $$
   - Union over Intersection ( $$ A \cup (B \cap C) $$ ): Combining a set with the common elements of other sets is the same as finding the union of the intersections separately.
     - Example: If $$ A = \{ \text{apple, banana} \} $$, $$ B = \{ \text{banana, cherry} \} $$, and $$ C = \{ \text{banana, date} \} $$, then $$ A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C) = \{ \text{apple, banana, cherry} \} $$

4. **De Morgan’s Laws**
   - Complement of Union ( $$(A \cup B)^C$$ ): The complement of the union is the same as the intersection of the complements.
     - Example: If $$ A = \{ \text{apple} \} $$, $$ B = \{ \text{banana} \} $$, and the universal set $$ U = \{ \text{apple, banana, cherry, date} \} $$, then $$ (A \cup B)^C = A^C \cap B^C = \{ \text{cherry, date} \} $$
   - Complement of Intersection ( $$(A \cap B)^C$$ ): The complement of the intersection is the same as the union of the complements.
     - Example: Using the same sets, $$ (A \cap B)^C = A^C \cup B^C = \{ \text{apple, banana, cherry, date} \}^C = \{ \text{cherry, date} \} $$

### Recap with Visualisation
- Union ( $$ A \cup B $$ ): Combining everything in both sets.
- Intersection ( $$ A \cap B $$ ): Finding what is common in both sets.
- Complement ( $$ A^C $$ ): Everything not in the set.
- Commutativity: Order doesn't matter.
- Associativity: Grouping doesn't matter.
- Distributive Laws: Combining and finding common elements can be distributed.
- De Morgan’s Laws: Complement of combined sets can be separated into individual complements.

These rules help us organise and understand groups of things better, making it easier to solve problems involving sets!


By understanding these basic concepts, you can solve problems involving groups of objects and how they interact with each other. It’s like using a superpower to organise and understand the world better!
### Example of Set Theory in AI: Image Classification

Imagine you're training a computer to recognise whether an image contains a cat or a dog. You have a collection of images, and you want the computer to learn from these images.

#### Sample Space and Events

1. **Sample Space (S)**:
   - This is the set of all possible images the computer might see.
   - Example: $$ S = \{\text{Image1}, \text{Image2}, \text{Image3}, \ldots, \text{ImageN}\} $$

2. **Events**:
   - **Event A**: Set of images containing cats.
   - **Event B**: Set of images containing dogs.
   - Example: $$ A = \{\text{Image2}, \text{Image4}, \text{Image6}\} $$
   - Example: $$ B = \{\text{Image1}, \text{Image3}, \text{Image5}\} $$

#### Using Set Operations in AI

1. **Union ( $$A \cup B$$ )**:
   - Represents all images that contain either cats or dogs or both.
   - Equation: $$ A \cup B $$
   - Example: If $$A = \{\text{Image2}, \text{Image4}, \text{Image6}\}$$ and $$B = \{\text{Image1}, \text{Image3}, \text{Image5}\}$$, then:
     $$ A \cup B = \{\text{Image1}, \text{Image2}, \text{Image3}, \text{Image4}, \text{Image5}, \text{Image6}\} $$

2. **Intersection ( $$A \cap B$$ )**:
   - Represents all images that contain both cats and dogs (though this might be rare in simple classification tasks).
   - Equation: $$ A \cap B $$
   - Example: If there's no overlap (no image contains both a cat and a dog):
     $$ A \cap B = \emptyset $$ (empty set, no common images)

3. **Complement ( $$A^C$$ )**:
   - Represents all images that do not contain cats.
   - Equation: $$ A^C = S - A $$
   - Example: If $$S = \{\text{Image1}, \text{Image2}, \text{Image3}, \text{Image4}, \text{Image5}, \text{Image6}\}$$ and $$A = \{\text{Image2}, \text{Image4}, \text{Image6}\}$$, then:
     $$ A^C = \{\text{Image1}, \text{Image3}, \text{Image5}\} $$

4. **Difference ( $$A - B$$ )**:
   - Represents all images that contain cats but not dogs.
   - Equation: $$ A - B $$
   - Example: If $$A = \{\text{Image2}, \text{Image4}, \text{Image6}\}$$ and $$B = \{\text{Image1}, \text{Image3}, \text{Image5}\}$$, then:
     $$ A - B = A $$ (since there's no overlap)

#### Practical Use in AI

In AI, especially in machine learning, we often deal with sets of data (like images) and use set theory to:

- **Classify data**: Determine which category an image belongs to (e.g., cat or dog).
- **Train models**: Use subsets of data (training set) to teach the model and another subset (test set) to check its accuracy.
- **Evaluate models**: Measure how well the model is performing by calculating intersections (correct classifications) and complements (errors).


### Summary

Set theory helps us organise and manipulate groups of data in AI, whether we're classifying images, training models, or evaluating performance. Understanding how sets work makes it easier to handle the large amounts of data AI models need to learn from.
