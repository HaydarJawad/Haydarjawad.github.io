Creating reliable security systems involves more than just installing the latest software or hardware. To do this successfully, four main elements need to work together:
<span class="p">
1.</span> <span class="gs">**Policy**</span>  
Policy is about knowing what you want to protect and what rules you need to follow to keep things safe. Think of it like the rules in a game that tell you how to play fairly. Policies define the security standards and procedures that must be followed to protect assets and information.
<span class="p">
2.</span> <span class="gs">**Mechanism**</span>  
Mechanism refers to the tools and methods used to protect things. For example, passwords, locks, or encryption (a way to scramble information so only the right people can read it). These are the practical implementations that enforce the policies.
<span class="p">
3.</span> <span class="gs">**Assurance**</span>  
Assurance is about making sure the tools and methods you use actually work well. It's like double-checking that the lock on your door really keeps people out. Assurance involves testing and validation to ensure that the security mechanisms are effective and reliable.
<span class="p">
4.</span> <span class="gs">**Incentives**</span>  
Incentives are about giving people good reasons to follow the rules and protect the system. It's also about understanding why someone might want to break the rules or attack the system. Effective incentives encourage compliance and vigilance among security personnel and users.

<span class="gu">## How These Elements Work Together</span>

These four elements are interconnected and influence each other. For example, after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, airport security policies changed to ban knives because the old rules only banned guns and bombs. The mechanisms to enforce this policy included metal detectors. However, the effectiveness (assurance) of these tools can vary, and people who work in security need proper incentives to do their job well.

Understanding why attackers might want to break the rules helps in designing better security systems. For instance, knowing that attackers could bypass security by exploiting certain loopholes leads to the development of more robust mechanisms and policies.

By integrating these elements—Policy, Mechanism, Assurance, and Incentives—you can create a comprehensive and reliable security system that not only protects assets but also adapts to evolving threats.

Below is a table that gives examples of different domains (bank, hospital, army, and home) aligned to the above four elements:
