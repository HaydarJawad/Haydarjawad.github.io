<h1 style="text-align: center; color: blue;">So why would we care about P=NP anyway</h1>


##### Haydar jawad, May 2024 



**Introduction**

Imagine you have a favourite game that you are very good at, but there’s a part of it you can’t figure out if it’s even possible to master. In the world of computer science, there’s a huge question that’s like this, called the P=NP problem. Scientists are trying to figure out if every problem that’s easy to check (NP) is also easy to solve (P). But why do many scientists believe that P is not equal to NP (P≠NP)?

### Why Scientists Bet P≠NP

Here are some reasons why scientists think P≠NP, explained in simple terms with some maths:

1. **Too Good to Be True**

If P were equal to NP, it would mean that all kinds of very hard problems suddenly have easy solutions. This seems too good to be true. For example, solving puzzles, cracking codes, and even creating new inventions would become easy. 

2. **Thousands of Problems Would Become Easy**

There are thousands of different problems in the NP group. If one problem in NP is easy to solve, then all of them would be. It’s hard to believe there’s a single method to solve all these different problems.

### Mathematical Examples

#### Example of a Problem in P: Sorting Numbers

Let's take a list of numbers and sort them. Sorting algorithms like quicksort or mergesort can do this in $$ O(n \log n) $$ time. Here’s how it works:

- **Problem:** Sort the list [5, 3, 8, 6, 2].
- **Solution:** Use an algorithm like mergesort.
- **Time Complexity:** $$ O(n \log n) $$.

$$ T(n) = n \log n $$

For example, if $$ n = 8 $$:

$$ T(8) = 8 \log 8 = 8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ steps} $$

Sorting is a P problem because it can be done quickly.

#### Example of a Problem in NP: Sudoku

Sudoku is a great example of an NP problem:

- **Problem:** Fill a 9x9 grid with numbers 1 to 9 so that each row, column, and 3x3 box contains all numbers from 1 to 9.
- **Solution:** Finding the solution can be very hard, but checking if a given solution is correct is easy.
- **Verification:** Check if each row, column, and box has numbers 1 to 9.

If someone gives you a filled Sudoku grid, you can check it quickly to see if it's correct.

### What If P=NP?

If P were equal to NP, it would mean that every problem that is easy to check is also easy to solve. This has huge implications, especially for cryptography. Here’s why:

1. **Cryptography Basics**

Cryptography is about creating codes that are hard to break. For example, when you send a message over the internet, it’s encrypted so that only the intended recipient can read it. This encryption relies on certain mathematical problems being hard to solve. 

2. **Example: RSA Encryption**

RSA encryption is a common method used to secure online communications. It relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime factors. For instance, if you multiply two large prime numbers together, it’s easy. But if you only have the product and not the original primes, figuring out the prime factors is very hard.

- **Problem:** Given a large number $$ N $$, find its prime factors.
- **Difficulty:** This is believed to be a hard problem, taking a long time to solve.

3. **Impact of P=NP on Cryptography**

If P=NP, it would mean there’s a quick way to solve this hard problem. In other words, if someone could find a fast algorithm to factorise large numbers, they could break RSA encryption easily.

- **Consequences:** 
  - **Broken Security:** All the encrypted messages that rely on RSA (like your online banking, emails, etc.) would no longer be secure.
  - **New Algorithms Needed:** Cryptographers would need to find new methods to secure communications that don’t rely on problems in NP.

### Could AGI Find the Solution?

**AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)** refers to a type of AI that has the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge in a way similar to a human being. The idea is that AGI would be capable of performing any intellectual task that a human can do.

1. **Problem-Solving Capabilities**

AGI could potentially find solutions to very complex problems because it would have the ability to think creatively, learn from experience, and use a vast amount of knowledge and computational power. This means AGI might be able to find an algorithm that solves NP problems efficiently, thereby proving that P=NP.

2. **Implications for Cryptography**

If AGI were to find a solution that proves P=NP, it would revolutionise many fields, including cryptography. All current cryptographic systems based on NP problems would become insecure. However, AGI could also help develop new cryptographic methods that do not rely on the hardness of NP problems.

3. **Current AI vs AGI**

Current AI, known as Narrow AI, is very good at specific tasks like playing chess or recognising images, but it cannot solve general problems like proving P=NP. AGI, on the other hand, would have the general problem-solving ability required to tackle such fundamental questions in computer science.

### Conclusion

Understanding the P=NP problem helps us see why it's such a big deal in computer science and cryptography. If P=NP, it would make solving hard problems easy, which sounds great, but it would also mean that current cryptographic methods would be useless, leading to a need for new ways to secure our data. AGI, with its advanced problem-solving abilities, could potentially find a solution to P=NP, but this would come with significant implications for security and technology. Scientists believe P≠NP because it seems too good to be true that all these hard problems could have easy solutio
