```pseudocode
% This is a simple test algorithm following the Quicksort format
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Check Probabilities of Image Classification Model}
\begin{algorithmic}
\PROCEDURE{CheckProbabilities}{$$sample\_space, event\_A, event\_B$$}
    \STATE $$total\_images \gets$$ \CALL{Length}{$$sample\_space$$}
    \IF{$$A > B$$}
        \STATE \CALL{Quicksort}{$$A, p, q - 1$$}
    \ENDIF
\ENDPROCEDURE
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
