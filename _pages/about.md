I am dedicated to implementing technology for the greater good, as I love the process of conceptualising ideas and iterating until they reach deployment. I have a deep appreciation for open source and the tremendous effort that engineers put into producing amazing software for humanity, a cause that I respect and embrace wholeheartedly.

My journey has always revolved around technologyâ€”from enterprise hardware servers, the Internet of Things, and AI to machine learning, cybersecurity, and research into various implementations of these technologies across sectors such as banking, law, and agriculture.

In addition to my technical pursuits, I have extensive experience managing major enterprise technology projects and programmes for various blue-chip companies in a consulting capacity. This role has honed my ability to navigate complex business environments and deliver solutions that align closely with corporate objectives.

My experience is business-focused first and technology-driven second because I strongly believe that without a clearly defined problem, rushing to implement technology results in a solution to a non-existent problem.
